## TypeScript
Introduction
TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it more robust and maintainable.

Basic Types
TypeScript introduces several basic types to help developers define the types of variables and values in their code. These include:

Boolean: Represents a logical value indicating true or false.
Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
String: Represents textual data as a sequence of characters.
Array: Represents a collection of elements of the same type.
Tuple: Represents an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element may have a different type.
Enum: Represents a set of named constants, typically used to define a set of related values.
Any: Represents a dynamic type that can hold any value.
Void: Represents the absence of a type, typically used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.
Null and Undefined: Represent values that are null or undefined, respectively.
Never: Represents the type of values that never occur.
Variables
In TypeScript, variables can be declared using the let keyword. They can also be explicitly typed using type annotations, or their types can be inferred by the TypeScript compiler. Variables can be declared without initialization, in which case their type is automatically set to any.

Type annotations can be used to explicitly specify the type of a variable, while type inference allows the TypeScript compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its initialization value.
