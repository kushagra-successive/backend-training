## Classes in TypeScript:
Definition:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods. It encapsulates data for the object and defines its behavior.
Properties:
Properties are variables declared within a class and define the characteristics of the class.
Constructor:
The constructor is a special method used for initializing object instances of the class. It is executed automatically when the object is created.
Methods:
Methods are functions defined within a class that perform actions or provide functionality related to the class.

## Interfaces in TypeScript:
Definition:
An interface is a way to define a contract in TypeScript. It defines the structure of an object by specifying the types and properties it must have.
Properties:
Properties in interfaces define the structure of an object. They specify the names and types of the properties that objects implementing the interface must have.
Methods:
Methods in interfaces define the signature of functions that objects implementing the interface must provide. They specify the names, parameters, and return types of the methods that implementing objects must have.
